    /// The idea here is to make the library unaware of the type of UI. An implementation of IView could be
    /// a console view, a WinForm view, a WPF view, whatever. A console view would be fundamentally different in that
    /// it would need to act synchronously and in a blocking way as opposed to GUI view that is event driven and uses
    /// the Windows message loop. Thus, a console view would have SupportsAwaitCommand set to True and would implement
    /// the AwaitCommand method, whereas others would have it False and call the SelectCommandAction when the user
    /// triggers a command.
